A square matrix, that is, one having the same number of rows and columns, is called a diagonal matrix if its only non-zero element are on the diagonal from upper left to lower right.
It is called upper triangular, if all elements below the diagonal are zeroes.
And lower triangular, if all elements above the diagonal are zeroes.

Write a program that reads a matrix and determines if it is one of these three special matrices.
