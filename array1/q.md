The first difference D1 of a sequence of A of N elements is obtained by subtracting each element, except the last, from the next element in the array. The second difference D2 is defined as the first difference of D1, and so on. For example, if

A = { 1, 2, 4, 7, 11, 16, 22 } then
D1 = { 1, 2, 3, 4 ,5, 6 }
D2 = { 1, 1, 1, 1, 1 }
D3 = { 0, 0, 0, 0 }


Write a program that reads a sequence of 25 elements in an array and finds its first, second, and third differences.
